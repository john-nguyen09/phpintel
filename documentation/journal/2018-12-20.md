## Time to get back to phpintel
- I was busy for the last few months with uni and work
- Now that the research has finished and I am waiting for response of the conference paper
- Got a little bit of time to re-visit this project

Now that I have had a look at the code and I found a few problems
- Using only indices for symbols does not really work
- E.g. I used to use name index for all the symbols while this is good for searching but after retrieving the symbol, there is no way to determine the type of the symbol
- It leads to saving the type of the symbol into database and a decoder to convert it back to the original objects
- The same document can have different types of symbols with the same name, e.g. class and function can have the same name. While when saving into database the name is the key so there can be only 1 instance
- Symbol's contructors require AST node and the php document. This causes the problem when decoding symbols from database, I need to get the AST node for the symbol. Hence more computation is needed and increasing the complexity
- In TypeScript, even though property is declared but its value is not initialised, using ```'property' in object``` to check if the ```object``` is an instance of a interface is not possible
