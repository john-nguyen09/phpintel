## Things I learned today which apply to this project
**[Inheritance is evil. Stop using it.](https://codeburst.io/inheritance-is-evil-stop-using-it-6c4f1caf5117) by Nicolò Pignatelli**
- Causes the issue of one change that changes everything
- Create more coupling which means child classes will depend deeply on parents
- Can cause unexpected behavior when changing parents, since not properties and methods are exactly the same

**Solution**
- Use dependency injection to utilise some properties and methods

**This project**
- Removed some inheritance but some inheritance cannot be easily removed
    - Symbol class: the approach is not to have any method, just declaring some properties which could avoid the problem of changing the class and the behavior is changed everywhere else
    - Reasons:
        - other classes have exactly the same properties and @nonenumerable tag
        - follow the rules at the beginning everything is treated as symbol

**Use class for types and name**
- Manipulating primitives is not a good idea [Developer Toolkit by Nicolò Pignatelli](https://drive.google.com/open?id=141VmyAfXlNK_xvfEwSB5f-Olghu7sz_1)
- There might be a problem that ```string[]``` is type ```string``` but they will be treated as different if they are string
- The class helps in resolve to FQN later when there is namespace
- Also helps in determining if the type is an array
