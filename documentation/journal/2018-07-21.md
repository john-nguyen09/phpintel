Initially I had thought that I can somehow improve the performance of [PHP Language Server](https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server) by optimising the tree analyser to not going back and forth the AST. Then, I discover that the parser is also a bottleneck.

Using my machine to benchmark, the specs as below:
- Intel Core i7 - 3612QM @ 2.10 GHz
- 8GB RAM DDR3
- 1 TB HDD 7200 RPM
- 8788 PHP files ([Moodle 3.5](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/tree/MOODLE_35_STABLE))

Tolerant PHP Parser takes 81 seconds to finish, while PHP Parser by Nikic takes 192 seconds.

Even though this result is faster than the PHP Parser by Nikic, but this is going to be a big bottleneck for any static analysis. Since my aim is to get the indexing at around 2 minutes.

While looking for other alternatives, I have come up with 2 fast parsers [php7parser](https://github.com/bmewburn/php7parser) and [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) with the support of [tree-sitter-php](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-php) and [node-tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/node-tree-sitter) binding.

## php7parser
### Pros
- Fastest of all parsers (14 seconds)
- [Intelephense](https://github.com/bmewburn/intelephense) uses this parser to do static analysis, the parse tree can be known by reading this.
### Cons
- Maintained by an individual, therefore it might not receive a huge support.

## tree-sitter
### Pros
- Incremental parsing, which is a huge advantage for language server.
- Still fast comparing to Tolerant PHP Parser.
### Cons
- Not as fast (24 seconds)
- Relatively new, therefore no documentation of tree structure.

# Current approach
- Pick php7parser for my project since it is kind of documented.
- Use another structure to transform the parse tree that structure for further indexation. This might reduce performance but not that much as seen in Intelephense.
- Thinking about using tree-sitter in the future and benchmark.
