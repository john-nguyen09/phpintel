## Symbol
- Initial thought about [symbols](../symbol.md)
- The idea of symbol is anything contains information to be analysed in a PHP document(File, Class, ClassHeader, Function, etc.)
- Most of symbols implement [Consumer](../consumer.md)
## SymbolParser
- A parser to parse AST tree to symbols
- The idea is to do depth-first traversal and push symbols onto the stack. While going back out of the depth, the symbols are consumed
- The root symbol is File, any symbols that are consumed by File are indexed
### How it works
- Push symbol to stack when doing preorder traversal
- Pop symbol when doing postorder traversal
- Popped symbol will be consumed by other symbols on the stack in backward order
- If the symbol is consumed, it will stop being consumed by other symbols
