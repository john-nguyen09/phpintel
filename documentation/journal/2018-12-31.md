## Time for reflection and future plan

## Abbreviations

Abstract Syntax Tree - AST

Fully Qualified Name - FQN

## Processes

**Analysing ASTs**
- Traversing the AST and extract symbol stack to do analysis
- This process should be lightweight and gather enough information needed for query process
- Important symbols are added into ```PhpDocument```

**Persisting symbols**
- Saving symbols into a database (LevelDB)
- Create indices for later query

**Query**
- Happens in providers (hover, definition, etc.)
- Use indices to retrieve information, further process needed (resolve reference type to FQNs)

## Decisions and implementations:
**Traversing the AST and convert them into symbol stack**

Background

- Inspired by [bmewburn, intelephense](https://github.com/bmewburn/intelephense)

Definition

- Traverse the AST in preorder and postorder
- The preorder and postorder are combined to a single tree traversing.
- Unused AST nodes are represented as ```null``` to compensate the balance when traversing
- Symbols are instances of classes in TypeScript
- AST nodes are transformed to symbols
- Symbols are pushed to the stack during preorder tranversing
- During postorder, symbols are popped and consumed by other symbols in the stack

Advantages

- Stack is easy to compute
- Having a single traversing through the AST tree (no walking forward and backward in the tree during the analysing process)

Disadvantages

- No backward referencing. This is a disadvantage for ```$this```, ```self``` and ```static``` cases.
- Consume is a bad name
- Unnecessary call to consume methods

Current implementation

- A scope property in ```$this```, ```self``` and ```static``` is defined, and is mutated while in ```class```, ```interface``` or ```trait``` scope. Mutating a symbol in another symbol might not be a good idea
- Symbols are not actually consumed but rather processed and determined whether to consume them
- Return ```true``` in ```consume``` method to indicate consumption to reduce unnecessary calls, but this is hard for maintenance

**Thoughts and next steps**

- Current approach is not easy for incremental parsing because it is not tree-based
- The next thing would be to resolve variables to def symbols for hover provider
- Once the resolver for references to definitions is implemented, it would be easy for other definition provider (very similar to hover)
- Implementing completion provider, there are 2 things for this:
    - Resolving references (self::, static::, SampleClass::, functionCa), resolving variables ($this->, $user->, $, $aVari)
    - Importantly, an approximate string matching algorithm that can be implemented in LevelDB. The first thought would be qgrams, however this is still in research
- Implementing signature help, this requires following:
    - Resolving function call to definitions
    - Resolving method call to definitions
    - Determine the position of parameter
