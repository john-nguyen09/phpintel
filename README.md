An early stage code static analyser for PHP, uses the great [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to provide IDE-like features to any editor.

The project uses [Tolerant PHP Parser](https://github.com/Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser) for generating the AST.

This project is still a Work-In-Process (WIP) which is not usable at the moment.

## Project aim
